# VoicePlayer
Voice recognition with Java and Sphinx-4 Framework

This project is only a prototype and has a few years (2010).

<b>There are some issues that you must fix before run it:</b>
* Add the .jar files (which are in the _"lib"_ directory) to the project, as libraries.
* In _"/src/reconheceComando/ReconheceComando.config"_, replace "{PLACEHOLDER_PATH}" by your own full path. Something like this: _"file:/home/user/Projects/VoicePlayer/src/reconheceComando"_. I didn't fix it yet, sorry.
